# Contributing to Verite Elements

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Verite Elements as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/verite/elements.git
cd elements

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development environment
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Storybook for component development
- Watch mode for TypeScript compilation
- Test runner in watch mode

## Project Structure

```
packages/
  stencil-library/      # Core web components
  react-library/        # React wrapper components
  vue-library/          # Vue wrapper components
  docs/                 # Documentation site
```

## Writing Components

### Component Checklist
- [ ] TypeScript types
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Storybook stories
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Accessibility tests
- [ ] Performance tests

### Example Component

```typescript
import { Component, Prop, h } from '@stencil/core';

@Component({
  tag: 'vui-button',
  styleUrl: 'button.css',
  shadow: true,
})
export class Button {
  @Prop() variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' = 'primary';
  
  render() {
    return (
      <button class={`btn btn-${this.variant}`}>
        <slot></slot>
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

## Code Style

We use:
- Prettier for formatting
- ESLint for linting
- Conventional Commits for commit messages

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
