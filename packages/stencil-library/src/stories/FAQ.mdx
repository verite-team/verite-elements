# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What makes Verite Elements different from other auth UI libraries?
Unlike most auth UI libraries that are framework-specific, Verite Elements uses web components, making it truly framework-agnostic. You can use it with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JS, and it won't conflict with your existing components.

### Do I need to use a specific backend?
No! While we provide easy integration with popular auth providers (Auth0, Firebase, etc.), you can use any backend. Our components emit standard events that you can handle however you need.

### What's the browser support like?
We support all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). For older browsers, we recommend using our polyfill bundle, though this is rarely needed as web components are now widely supported.

## Technical Questions

### Can I use this with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?
Yes! We're fully compatible with SSR frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and others. Our components hydrate properly and avoid the dreaded flash of unstyled content (FOUC).

### How do I handle form submission?
Our components emit standard events that you can listen for:

```javascript
const form = document.querySelector('vui-signin');
form.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
  const formData = e.detail;
  // Handle submission
});
```

### Can I customize the validation rules?
Absolutely! While we provide sensible defaults, you can override or add custom validation rules:

```javascript
const form = document.querySelector('vui-form');
form.validationRules = {
  password: [
    {
      validate: (value) => value.length >= 10,
      message: 'Password must be at least 10 characters'
    }
  ]
};
```

## Styling & Customization

### Can I use my own CSS framework?
Yes! Our components use CSS custom properties (variables) for styling, making them easy to theme. They won't conflict with Bootstrap, Tailwind, or other CSS frameworks.

### How do I create a dark theme?
We provide a built-in dark theme, but you can also create your own:

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --vui-background: #1a1a1a;
  --vui-text: #ffffff;
  /* other variables */
}
```

## Performance & Security

### What's the bundle size impact?
Our core bundle is around 12KB gzipped. Components are loaded on-demand, so you only pay for what you use.

### How do you handle security?
We follow security best practices including:
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Input sanitization
- Secure defaults
- Regular security audits

### Is there a performance impact?
Web components are lightweight and run close to the metal. Our components are tree-shakeable and lazy-loaded, so they won't impact your initial page load.
