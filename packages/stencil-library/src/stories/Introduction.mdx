# Introduction

Welcome to Verite Elements â€” a robust library of web components designed to simplify authentication UI development. Built with Stencil.js, our components help developers implement secure, accessible, and customizable authentication flows with minimal effort.

## What is Verite Elements?

Verite Elements provides framework-agnostic web components focused on authentication interfaces. Our library excels at three core areas:

- **Authentication UI Components:** Pre-built, customizable components for sign-in, sign-up, and one-time password flows
- **Built-in Form Validation:** Robust client-side validation with customizable rules and error messages
- **Event System:** Rich event system for tracking authentication flows and user interactions

## Key Benefits

- **Framework Agnostic:** Works seamlessly with React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript
- **Zero Dependencies:** Lightweight and conflict-free - just what you need
- **Developer Experience:** TypeScript support, extensive documentation, and predictable APIs
- **Enterprise Ready:** Accessibility compliant, RTL support, and built-in localization

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of implementing a sign-in form:

```html
<vui-i18n-provider locale="en">
  <vui-auth-form
    action="signin"
    elements='["email", "password"]'
    submit-label="$authForm.submit"
    forgot-password-label="$authForm.forgotPassword"
  ></vui-auth-form>
</vui-i18n-provider>
```
